5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike (such as good or poor layout, presentation of or overload of  information, easy or hard to navigate, loads quickly or slowly considering the data on the page, fun or frustrating, flashy or boring, cute or dreadful, great or poor interactivity, whatever else you might think of!),

The oregonstate.gov website is laid out good enough on a laptop or PC, but on mobile you cannot open the tabs on the grants.
The tiktok.com is good because it is good at holding my attention.
Fandom.com is good because it feels engaging and fun.
Expedia is not transparent about the fees that they charge.
Craigslist is a website that I think was good at one point but now has become out of date.

a link to the site and what you like or dislike and ways that you think each of the 5 websites might be improved,

oregonstate.gov I think can use a better mobile UI
Tiktok.com I think can be improved by not pushing so much sponsored content through the feed.
Craigslist.com can be improved by an overhaul of the website to make it feel more engaging.
Expedia.com needs to be more transparent about their prices.
Fandom.com needs to reduce the amount of ads.
