This is a new version of my previous clicker game using CSS JS and HTML
In this version I have added a bit more features like an upgrade system and a way to save upgrades

  To use this you will need to have node.js installed. https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs
The page will save in sync when the game is being played using the writeToFile() function from node js https://nodejs.org/en/learn/manipulating-files/writing-files-with-nodejs
It will also use readFile from nodejs to read from that file if it existsto load in the score.

To run this type "node serve.js" in your terminal then in your browser go to:http://localhost:8000
If the save button is pressed it should create a score.txt file that has the number of clicks.
On reloading the server the score will be read from this file
