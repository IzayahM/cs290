For this website I think Im going to make a clicker game that will run on a server using node.js to run js on the server.
This app will be able to save user data (score) and read score from the file.
In the future if I decide to continue this I might make it more styilized with animations and upgrades but for this implementation I am goint to keep it pretty basic.
 
  To use this you will need to have node.js installed. https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs
The page will save in sync when the game is being played using the writeToFile() function from node js https://nodejs.org/en/learn/manipulating-files/writing-files-with-nodejs
It will also use readFile from nodejs to read from that file if it existsto load in the score.

To run this type "node serve.js" in your terminal then in your browser go to:http://localhost:8000
If the save button is pressed it should create a score.txt file that has the number of clicks.
On reloading the server the score will be read from this file.
