For this assignment I am planning on using the same website as assignment 2 but putting more polish on it by adding different css styles.

I am planning on adding a horizontal menu that follows as you scroll and when the window shrinks it will show an icon that you click 
to show the menu so it doesnt take up the screen.

The menu will have genre, personal picks, and reviews where if you hover over any of these options subcategories will pop up.
The menu will also have a search bar that will most likely not have any actual function until later.

Since the main goal is to just add polish to the site not much is goin to change of the contents from the last version just mainly how it is laid out.

I got most of my information on how to do these things on w3 schools and adjusted them to fit my site
make sure to have the images folder as well as the html files to run correctly
