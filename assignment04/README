For this assignment I am planning on just making a simple demonstartion of javascript.

I will have a seperate css style to stylize it a bit but I will do that after the site has been made.

What I want to try to do in my implementation is to have a box that takes input from a text prompt to create a set of data for the type of car they have.

If I can figure it out, I want to use two libraries: Splide (https://splidejs.com/#06) and React (https://react.dev). 
Splide is used to create slide shows and I would use that to create a slide show of cars.
I want to use React to make the user interface more robust.

while I was making this I think im going to use the google apis library to store values
ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js

<h1>What Kind of car</h1>
<div class= "container">
//this is where the input would be taken and the prompt will be shown in boxes.
//this will iterate a few times to collect all the data
</div>


<script>
let make(str), model(str), mileage(int), clean_title(bool);
const cars = ["An array of different car makes"]

function greet()
//Some greet function to greet the user by the name they enter

//google apis library
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<input type="text" class="item_name" value="model">
<input type="text" class="item_name" value="make">
<input type="int" class="item_name" value="mileage">
<input type="bool" class="item_name" value="clean_title">
// I will try to make something that catches invalid inputs
// A button that does the following after you enter the info{
//display all car values

//some conditional telling you if you have a lot of miles

//I will also try to compare values int the car array list to see if it is the registry
}

</script>
</body>
